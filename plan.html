Looking Back - The first 30 years! <br>
<br>
 Print music<br>
The Townsville Community Music Centre celebrated its 30th year in 2013. <br>
<br>
It has been constantly changing over the years to keep up to date with the musical tastes and needs of the Townsville community. As part of the relocation of the Music Centre to the <br>
Civic Theatre, Bronia Renison and Jean Dartnall, both librarians, have assessed the old collection of sheet music, books and recorded music which the centre has been storing, unused, for <br>
many years. Sometimes older things have to be discarded to make way for the new, but the Music Centre is aware that older material may still have value. <br>
The National Library of Australia has an online catalogue (TROVE) that lists not only its own holdings but also information about items held by many other libraries around Australia.<br> 
Using this catalogue Bronia and Jean have identified at least 150 items of music that are not held by any of the country's major libraries. These items have been donated to the National Library <br>
to include in their collection and thus made available to all historians and musicians.<br>

Also discovered in the old collection were some pieces relevant to North Queensland. Local musicians performed these at a musical social afternoon on Sunday April 21st in C2 at the <br>
Civic Theatre. The remaining sheet music, books and CDs were put on display and distributed free of charge to the local music community.<br>
<br>
A Brief History<br>
by Jean Dartnall<br>

1983	 	The Townsville Community Music Centre was established at a public meeting on May 24th. Then Deputy Mayor, Ken McElligott, opened the meeting and presented a cheque for $50 <br>
from the City Council to cover initial petty cash, the Centre's first funds. At the meeting an executive committee was formed. Over the next few weeks that committee drafted a constitution<br> 
which was endorsed at another public meeting on June 15th. Fred Thompson was Chairman from September 1983, with Gordon Dean as his Deputy and Jan Eagleton as Secretary.<br>
1984	-	Mira Henderson, who had extensive experience in community music work in England, was the first staff member. (Her position was Acting Director because she was only in Townsville for <br>
a brief spell.) She instigated a series of classes starting in 1984 using the skills of people living in Townsville to enhance and encourage music learners of all ages.<br>
1985	-	Kirsty Veron was appointed as the first Director. Kirsty was very interested in teaching music to children and had worked with Mira in the 1983 classes. She held this position until <br>
1988 leading the new organisation into a strong position in the Townsville arts community.<br>
1985	-	The Music Centre produced Benjamin Britten's Noyes Fludde in St James Anglican Cathedral. This involved hundreds of children and some of Townsville's best known (and loved) musicians. <br>
It was produced by Rachel Berker (now Rachel Matthews) and involved Bernie Lannigan and Sandra Voss in the main parts rehearsed by Bill Williams; Donna McMahon and Jenny Carr rehearsing the strings <br>
and recorders and guest conductor Donald Hollier. This was by the no means the only major production mounted by the Music Centre but was probably the largest.<br>
1987	-	This was the year of the first fund raising dinner. These dinners became a tradition as they were a wonderful mixture of good food, good wine and good music. The first ones were held <br>
at the home of Paul and June Tonnoir in North Ward. Later they moved to the Bishop's Lodge as guests of the Anglican Bishop. Attendees would often book their tickets for the next year's dinner <br>
as soon as they had attended this one. They ran until 2004.<br>
1988	-	Mary Lou Schoenfeldt was appointed as Administrator. Although this was initially a small part time job with limited responsibilities, Mary Lou made the job, the Centre and indeed music<br>
 in Townsville, her own. She was a wonderful asset to the Centre and to the cultural life of the City until she had to retire due to ill health in 2003.<br>
1990	-	This year the first lunchtime concert was held at the PercTucker Gallery. The importance of providing performance opportunities for emerging musicians had become evident and from this<br>
time, for a number of years, one of the major activities of the Centre was the production and management of concerts.<br>
1999	-	Arts Queensland had been a major funder of Music Centre activities for a number of years but in this year they agree to provide funding on a three year basis. This made it much easier <br>
for the Centre to plan ahead and reduced the time that had to be spent on repetitive grant applications. This arrangement ran until 2004.<br>
2003	-	A spectacular variety concert was held at the Townsville Civic Theatre to celebrate twenty years of the Music Centre and as a tribute to May Lou.<br>
2005	-	The Centre moved to offices in the Old Magistrate's Court.<br>
More details of the period 1983 - 2008 can be found in the book, <br>
"Townsville Community Music Centre: some memories of the first 25 years" <br>
by Jean Dartnall. (Copies available from the Music Centre)<br>
2012	-	The Centre moved to its present office in the Townsville Civic Theatre building.<br>

<br>
Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs on the Strand. <br>
I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform. <br>
Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music. <br>
I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites. <br>
Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7. <br>
<br>

Aquapella are 50 singers from the Townsville area bringing you a cappella world music at its very best: inspiring and uplifting harmonies from around the globe. A South African<br>
 party song, a Hungarian love triangle, "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" in French - a sumptuous variety of different languages, stories, rhythms and moods to entertain and move you in <br>
the wonderful common language of music. Come along and travel the world by song!<br>
<br>
Choir director Beat Lehmann was born in Switzerland where he first became involved in choir music by participating in classical productions like Handel's Messiah, Mozart's Mass in C <br>
minor etc. A study year abroad gave him the opportunity to sing with the Pontardullais Welsh Male Choir. After completing an M.A. in Social Anthropology he concentrated <br>
on his other passion, dance, directing a Modern Dance Company for several years. In 1986, Beat migrated to Australia where he completed a Ph.D. in Linguistics and involved<br>
himself in choir music again. For 12 years he conducted AkaBella, a well-known world music choir from Bellingen, NSW. AkaBella participated in major festivals like the National<br>
Folk Festival in Canberra, the Bellingen Global Carnival and theWoodford Folk Festival where they featured in the ABC documentary ìFestival on Fire and launched their first CD <br>
 'Mosaic'. Beat moved to Magnetic Island in 2003 and has established a similarly successful world music choir for the Townsville area. Beat's choirs focus on the rich musical heritage <br>
of cultures around the globe. A South African party song, a Hungarian love triangle, a Mexican lullaby, a French version of 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' to delve into the incredible <br>
 variety and depth of a cappella world music and the cultures it represents, is not only fun, but a very enriching and uplifting experience.<br>

The Camerata Singers<br>
 Poms from Oz <br>
The concept of the Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly <br>
lacking for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dall'Osto, has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by performing <br>
at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotter's Markets in the mall. <br>
<br>
The Camerata Singers comprises a group of trained singers, both male and female, from age 18 and over who strive to provide quality performances in a range of styles from classical <br>
through to A cappella and contemporary. A number of members also regularly participate in local music theatre and theatre productions. For further information or bookings contact the Music Centre 4724 2086<br>

The Stokes Nicholson Big Band was formed in 1991 through collaboration between the late Roy Stokes and Les Nicholson. Each man had his own individual reasons for wanting a Big Band,<br>
perhaps influenced by the difference in their ages with Roy being 17 years older than Les. Roy wanted to create an opportunity to keep experienced musicians playing challenging music <br>
so their talents didn't go rusty. Les came from a different perspective and wanted to provide an opportunity for music students of all ages to sit beside experienced jazz musicians to <br>
<br>
A number of experienced musicians were invited to join the various sections of the new Big Band with most sections being led by a member of Les' already well-established Pacific Mainstream<br>
Jazz Band. The original Principals were Roy Stokes (not a member of PMJB), saxophone; Les Nicholson, trumpet; Neville Minon, trombone; and Bob Hebden, rhythm. Roy, Neville and Peter Alloway <br>
were all still private music teachers at this time and some of their pupils were the first students to be part of this adventure.<br>
<br>
The Stokes Nicholson Big Band was up and running, meeting once a month for rehearsals with an expectation that each section would practise individually or as a group in between these rehearsals.<br>
<br>
Sadly Roy passed away on 1st January 1993 after a period of illness. Les continued to manage the band and conduct rehearsals, as well as playing first trumpet. <br>
In 1997 he enlisted the help of John Ruffle who took on the role of Musical Director, allowing Les to relax a little and enjoy his playing more. <br>
Roy would no doubt be very proud to see how much his beloved Big Band has developed since its formation as it is now a very accomplished band with a diverse repertoire and the technical <br>
expertise capable of backing great Jazz singers.<br>
<br>
The band today demonstrates it has achieved the aims of both Roy and Les with experienced musicians arriving in town and feeling very proud to join such a powerful big band.<br>
A number of the original student members from 1991 are still in the band and have now joined the ranks of the experienced musicians and new <br>
students are still progressing from school bands to the Stokes Nicholson Big Band.
